Why do you need Shadow Illuminator Pro v2.1.8?
 
Many photos suffer from exposure problems, especially when they are taken in low-light or high-contrast situations. For example, if you take a photo of a sunset, you may end up with a dark foreground and a bright sky, or vice versa. This can ruin the mood and the beauty of your photo.
 
Another common problem is when you have a subject that is partially in the shadow and partially in the light. This can create unwanted shadows or highlights on the face or the body, making the subject look unnatural or unflattering.
 
These problems can be fixed with Shadow Illuminator Pro v2.1.8, which allows you to adjust the exposure of your photos in a smart and easy way. You can balance the shadows and highlights in your photos, and bring out the details that are hidden or washed out.
